 = mobile test node =

mobile node, gps trace, 54Mbps mcast rate
2 tests performed
mobile_node0.tar.gz
mobile_route-0.gpx

mobile_node1.tar.gz
mobile_route-1.gpx

= running test node =

same as above but running


= netperf test =

24Mbps mcast rate, netperf to a far away node

first test (test 0): selected address order

second test: changed protocol order

third test: 30 seconds netperf 30 seconds sleep, changed trace script to send 3 probes


NOTES FOR POST-PROCESSING: if a node is completely disconnected (i.e. all the traceroutes don't reach a node) don't consider that netperf

there was a revert to a 54Mbps network 8 minutes before 1366459808.15, probably during the third test
HT40+ has constraints on the multicast rate


fourth test: 6Mbps

fifth test: all the protocols on 5GHz only

= random ping test =

Multicast rate is now 6Mbps

first test: sequential pings

second test: parallel pings, some possible work going on on the mesh
third test: parallel pings, mesh only on 5GHz
